This directory plays the role of /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib in a normal
installation hierarchy.  

It is here so that we can freely use tools like virtualenv without any need to
install pypy system-wide, but just by using the root directory of the svn
checkout as sys.prefix: this way, the stdlib can always be found in 
sys.prefix + '/lib/pypyX.Y'
