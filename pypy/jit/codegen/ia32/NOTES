Hi Fijal :-)

You're looking too much at the new backend and not enough at the old
one.  There is no need to make operation classes at all; instead
method call like genop2("int_add") should render the machine code
directly and return a fresh IntVar.  Likewise, I don't know if the
RegAlloc object makes sense for now: we don't need to remember the
list of operations, and the position of each variable should probably
just be stored in the GenVars directly as an attribute, with some
methods to get them (again, as in the old backend).

Also, don't worry about translation right now (skip the corresponding
tests before you have more tests passing)
