what we removed
================

  - JIT

  - LLVM backend

  - JS backend

  - Aspect oriented programming

  - Logic objspace

  - CPython extension compiler


what we added
==============

  - 2.5.2

  - ctypes

  - more modules: pysqlite & co.

  - new garbage collectors: moving GCs, e.g. generational, hybrid, etc., threads+gc work

  - memory wise optimizations (check it): mark-compact GC, shared instance
    dictionaries also for instances of old-style classes; user class instances
    often 50% of CPython size!

  - performance improvements: between 0.8-2x (and in some corner case 3-4x)
    the time spent by CPython

  - pypy-jvm

  - improved pypy-cli clr module

  - compilation to maemo

  - reflective objspace (???)

  - mention new jit developments, even if they are not included (???)

  - check more what we did in the cleanup sprint

  - testing infrastructure

  - classic classes are by default now

  - examples of external libraries/app we run: pyglet, django, pylons,
    bittorrent, nevow, pynax, twisted, sympy

  - more windows support

  - PyPy's stackless module more complete: we added channel preferences which
    change details of the scheduling semantics.

  - better profiling support for PyPy

  - sandboxing

  - easy_install/distutils support
