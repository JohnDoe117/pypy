pypy-0.8.0: Translatable compiler/parser and more speed 
==============================================================

The highlights of this third release of PyPy are:

- Translatable parser and AST compiler

- Speed enhancements. Translated PyPy is about 10 times slower
  than CPython on pystones (release-0.7.0 was about 200  times
  slower)

The release includes the snapshots of the following interesting
sub projects:

- a socket module
- the start of a stackless implementation
- the OOtyper. A rtyper replacement for highlevel backends 
  (squeak, ...)
- A javascript backend
- A (PPC) assembler backend

What is PyPy (about)? 
------------------------------------------------

PyPy is a MIT-licensed research-oriented reimplementation of
Python written in Python itself, flexible and easy to
experiment with.  It translates itself to lower level
languages.  Our goals are to target a large variety of
platforms, small and large, by providing a compilation toolsuite
that can produce custom Python versions.  Platform, Memory and
Threading models are to become aspects of the translation
process - as opposed to encoding low level details into a
language implementation itself.  Eventually, dynamic
optimization techniques - implemented as another translation
aspect - should become robust against language changes.

Note that PyPy is mainly a research and development project
and does not by itself focus on getting a production-ready
Python implementation although we do hope and expect it to
become a viable contender in that area sometime next year. 


Where to start? 
-----------------------------

Getting started:    http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/getting-started.html

PyPy Documentation: http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/ 

PyPy Homepage:      http://codespeak.net/pypy/

The interpreter and object model implementations shipped with
the 0.8 version can run on their own and implement the core
language features of Python as of CPython 2.4.  However, we still
do not recommend using PyPy for anything else than for education, 
playing or research purposes.  

Ongoing work and near term goals
---------------------------------

PyPy has been developed during approximately 16 coding sprints
across Europe and the US.  It continues to be a very
dynamically and incrementally evolving project with many
one-week meetings to follow. 

PyPy has been a community effort from the start and it would
not have got that far without the coding and feedback support
from numerous people.   Please feel free to give feedback and 
raise questions.

have fun, 
    
    the pypy team, of which here is a partial snapshot
    of mainly involved persons: 

    Armin Rigo, Samuele Pedroni, 
    Holger Krekel, Christian Tismer, 
    Carl Friedrich Bolz, Michael Hudson, 
    and many contributors: http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/contributor.html 

PyPy development and activities happen as an open source project  
and with the support of a consortium partially funded by a two 
year European Union IST research grant. Here is a list of 
the full partners of that consortium: 
        
    Heinrich-Heine University (Germany), AB Strakt (Sweden)
    merlinux GmbH (Germany), tismerysoft GmbH(Germany) 
    Logilab Paris (France), DFKI GmbH (Germany)
    ChangeMaker (Sweden), Impara (Germany)
