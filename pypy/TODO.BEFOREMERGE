* check if seqinterface.py is still needed or not

* remove space.unpacktuple(), replace it with space.viewtuple()

* viewtuple() should also *check* the type of its argument instead
  of segfaulting :-/   (that's also an issue in pypy/dist)

* use viewtuple() instead of viewiterable() in pycode.py:descr_code__new__()

* add objspace.unpackiterable shortcuts

* "translate.py -b cli" doesn't annotate any more
